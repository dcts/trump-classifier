# Classify Trump Images with P5.js and ML5
Eventially this should become a google chrome extension that replaces all images of donald trump by kitties or puppies. After doing some research, there seem to be already some extensions out there. However they didnt work well for me:
- [Chrome Detrumpify](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/detrumpify/hfhaalldkgmfbjjehkiddheghljjdjln)
- [Firefox Detrumpify](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/detrumpify/)
